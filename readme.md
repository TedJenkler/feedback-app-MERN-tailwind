## My Process

### Built With

- **React** for building user interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **Node.js** and **Express.js** for backend API development
- **MongoDB** for database storage
- **Vite** as the frontend build tool
- **Flexbox** for responsive design and layout

### Learnings

During this project, I focused on:

- **Redux Toolkit:** Managing complex state efficiently.
- **Responsive Design:** Using Flexbox to ensure a consistent experience across different devices.
- **Form Handling and Validation:** Strengthening data integrity through robust validation techniques.
- **Node.js and Express.js:** Structuring scalable backend applications.
- **MongoDB:** Gaining hands-on experience with database management.
- **Animations:** Enhancing the user experience with smooth menu and element animations.
- **Testing:** Beginning to explore testing methodologies, though not fully implemented in this project.

### Continued Development

In the future, I aim to expand the app's functionality with:

- Full authentication to ensure only post owners can edit or delete their posts.
- A user dashboard for managing profiles and feedback submissions.
- Additional features for exploring projects and providing feedback across different areas.
